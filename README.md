# Final Blockchain Project — Crowdfunding + Reward Token (Testnet)

## Idea

We act as a mediator between factories (suppliers) and resellers who want to sell products but don't have storage or production.
Resellers pool funds to finance large factory batches. The system is implemented as a decentralized crowdfunding app.
Users contribute test ETH and receive internal ERC-20 reward tokens proportional to their contribution.

## Requirements (from assignment)

- Ethereum Testnet only (Sepolia / Holesky / Local)
- MetaMask integration
- Crowdfunding campaigns: create, contribute, track contributions, finalize by deadline
- ERC-20 reward token minted automatically for contributions

## Planned Architecture

- **Smart contracts**
  - `CampaignFactory` / `Crowdfunding` contract for campaigns
  - `RewardToken` (ERC-20) minted during contributions
- **Frontend**
  - JS app (MetaMask + Ethers.js) to create campaigns, contribute, show balances
- **Docs**
  - Architecture, decisions, deployment and testnet instructions

## Repository Structure

- `contracts/` — Solidity contracts (coming soon)
